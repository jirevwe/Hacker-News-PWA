# TechCabel PWA

This is my first Progressive Web App... so bear with me
It's still very shitty... The method I used to load data from the API is..... well.... not so awesome...
I've also not done articles view yet...
Also, I did it in less than 24hrs so... (I have no excuses though ðŸ™„) 
It looks ugly too... I dubbed css (I'm not a css person, sorry)

It's aLIVE!!! [TechCabal PWA Trial](https://tc-pwa.herokuapp.com/)
